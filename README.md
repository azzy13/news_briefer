# news_briefer

A full stack web app which fetches data from newsapi.org/ and displays news just like in any modern news app.

Alas can't deploy this because apparently since 22 May 2020 they changed the liberties of the free developer 
keys and now they reject any request using that key that is not coming from localhost. You need to buy one of 
the keys intended for projects on production. Plan costs 449/849$ so no, thank you.

To use this app - 
1) Install dependencies using "npm i"
2) Run "npm run start"
